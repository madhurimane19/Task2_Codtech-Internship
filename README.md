Task:
PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION
A simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous
target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared
error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the
regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

I create a linear model of machine learning in python. I used python machine learning libraries to 
complete this task. 
1. Import libraries that we need to model creation and then upload dataset.
2. describe data and clean it fill the null values.
3. data preprocessing and data visualisation.
4. Exploratory data analysis.
5. feature engineering.
6. train and test data, then model creation.
